# xtal-element

xtal-element is yet another base class to use for creating web components.  The great thing about web components is that they are the web equivalent of Martin Luther King's "I have a dream" speech.  Little web components built with tagged template literals can connect with little web components built with Elm, and web components will be judged by the content they provide, rather than superficial technical distinctions. 

xtal-element's target audience is those who are looking for a base class that:

1.  Will benefit from the implementation of HTML Modules -- The default rendering library is focused around template-based UI definitions, rather than JSX or tagged-literals, to define the HTML structure.  It out polymer's Polymer!
2.  Provides first-class support for progressive enhancement, low bandwidth.
3.  Is Typescript friendly.
