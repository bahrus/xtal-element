When, in the Course of web development, it becomes necessary to migrate to a new way of building and connecting components together, and to dissolve the tight coupling which has heretofore made this far more difficult than what developers should be entitled to, a decent respect for the excellent, opinionated Web Component Libraries that already exist, requires that a lengthy explanation for the kinds of problems xtal-element assumes to solve well, and why this requires the introduction of yet another web component helper library, and is declaratively declared.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, after bumbling around for months and months:

    <summary>1.  All UI Libraries Are Created Equal</summary>

The great thing about web components is that little web components built with tagged template literals can connect with little web components built with Elm, and web components will be judged by the content they provide, rather than superficial internal technical library choices. 

For example, an interesting debate that has existed for a number of years has been between OOP vs functional programming.  Efforts to "embrace the duality paradox" like Scala and F# always appealed to me.  In the realm of UI development, this has been an interesting dichotomy to follow.  Traditionally, JavaScript was a unique (?) "function first" language, which seemingly [inspired some envy / second guessing](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/08/01/can-your-programming-language-do-this/) from the [everything is a class class of developers](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-everything-have-to-be-in-a-class-in-Java?share=1).  The introduction of classes into JavaScript has been met with some healthy skepticism.  The "hooks" initiative adds an interesting twist to the debate, and might strike the right balance for some types of components.  Evidently, the result has been less boilerplate code, which can only be good.  Perhaps the learning curve is lower as well, and that's great.

xtal-element takes the view that classes are a great addition to the JavaScript language, even if they don't solve every issue perfectly.  Some points raised by the React team do hit home with me regarding classes.

    <summary>My personal journey with classes</summary>

Speaking personally, I came from an academic (mathematical) background, and functions felt much more natural to me.  Yes, I saw the need for namespaced functions, and having the ability to hold data structures with nested sub-structures.  But the way people gushed about *combining these two things into one entity* simply left me scratching my head.  The examples I would read were c++ books that would start with Giraffes and Dogs, and then jump into describing how to create a Windows window, and I would get lost about 5 pages in.  Visual Basic (originally codenamed ["Thunder"](http://www.forestmoon.com/birthofvb/birthofvb.html), maybe because of its emphasis on making it easy to respond to events?), in contrast, simply required an animated gif to explain, and it didn't even use classes originally!   I simply didn't see the appeal of classes, until the day I joined an actual software company, and worked with problems centered around database tables, with customers, employees, transactions.  Finally, the lightbulb lit in my mind.  I can certainly see why a new developer would also question the need to learn the subtleties of classes just to wire a button to a textbox.  Add to that the subtleties of "this" and the syntax is a little clunkier (new class()).doFunction()...  )

Yes, I did think quite a bit about the question, and playing around a bit, before landing on the current approach that this library uses / encourages.

I think one factor that needs to be considered when weighing the pro's and con's between classes and functions for defining components, is another duality paradox:  the "Ã  la carte vs. buffet duality paradox."

Are we:

1.  Creating, with tender loving care, a component meant to have a minimum footprint, while being highly reusable, leverageable in multiple frameworks / no frameworks, loading synchronously / asynchronously, bundled / not bundled, etc?
2.  Engaging in RAD-style creation of a local component only to be used in a specific way by one application or one component?

xtal-element is a bit more biased towards the former, but strives not to sacrifice the second goal as much as possible.  Judge for yourself, I guess.

So xtal-element encourages use of classes in a way that might avoid some of the pitfalls, while benefitting from the really nice features of classes, namely:

1.  Support for easily tweaking one custom element with another (method overriding).
2.  Taking advantage of the nice way classes can help organize data and functionality together.

    <summary>2.  I am FROOP</summary>

    
xtal-element embraces the duality paradox between Functional and OOP by following a pattern we shall refer to as FROOP:  Functional reactive object-oriented preening.

Properties are entirely defined and configured via JSON-serializable configurations.  The properties are there on the custom element prototype, but they are created dynamically by the trans-render / xtal-element library from the configurations provided by the developer.

Should decorators ever reach stage 3, they will also be supported.

This configuration is extended by trans-render's/xtal-element's "FROOP Orchestrator" to provide a kind of "service bus" that can easily integrate lots of tiny, loosely coupled "action methods."  Action methods of a class (or mixin) are functions -- methods and/or property arrow functions, which impose one tiny restriction:  Such methods should expect that the first (and really only) parameter passed in will be an instance of the class (or custom element) it acts on.  In other words, the "inputs" of the method will be already set property changes.  The orchestrator allows the developer to pinpoint which action methods to call when properties change. *Ideally*, the signatures of such ideal action methods would all either look like:

```TypeScript
class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement{
    myActionMethod({myProp1, myProp2}: this) => {
        ...
        return {
            myProp3,
            myProp4
        } as Partial<this>;
    }

    async myAsyncActionMethod({myProp1, myProp2}: this) => {
        ...
        return {
            myProp3,
            myProp4
        } as Partial<this>;
    }
}
```

together with 

```TypeScript

/**
 * Out of class Action Methods are shared across all instances, so better performance
 * *
 **/

const myOutOfBodyDeclarativeActionMethod = ({self, myProp1, myProp2}: MyCustomElement) => ({
    myProp3,
    myProp4
} as Partial<MyCustomElement>);

/**
 * Some heavy lifting out of body, non declarative action method (which is really a dynamic property of a class instance)
 * that could be dynamically imported and progressively enhance the custom element
 */
const myAsyncOutOfBodyActionMethod = async ({self, myProp1, myProp2}: MyCustomElement) => {
    //lots and lots of heavy code, combined with lots of dependencies...
    return {
        myProp3,
        myProp4
    } as Partial<MyCustomElement>

};

class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement{
    self = this;
    myInternalActionMethod = ({self, myProp1, myProp2}: this) => {
        self.#myPrivateMethod(); //works!
        return {
            myProp3,
            myProp4
        } as Partial<MyCustomElement>;
    }
    myOutOfBodyDeclarativeActionMethod = myOutOfBodyDeclarativeActionMethod; 
    myAsyncOutOfBodyActionMethod = myAsyncOutOfBodyActionMethod; // this is a property, and could utilize the FROOP orchestrator to activate content progressively
}

```

What all these action methods have in common, is they don't directly have any side effects.  Ideally, they would generally all be self contained "nano-methods".  The FROOP orchestrator centralizes the pain and blame for causing side effects.

However, that's just the ideal.  As mentioned initially, the only hard rule for action methods is they should be able to take as the first argument an instance of the class (custom element).
